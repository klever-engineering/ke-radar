# Radar Project Minutes

## 2026-01-28
- Set up the technology surveillance program under `/radar` with roadmap, SOP, runbook, agent spec, templates, and metrics definitions.
- Added the first pilot scaffold for "Curated shared instructions for software teams" (plan, ADR, demo, eval rubric, Dockerfile).
- Ran the pilot in a Docker sandbox, generated baseline/post metrics JSON, and produced results JSON.
- Completed the pilot report and decision memo with a recommendation to continue on real tasks.
- Pulled ThoughtWorks Technology Radar volumes 31–33 into `/radar/data/` and generated `/radar/data/radar_blips.json` with a parsing script.
- Registered the radar data source in the context catalog and added a local README for radar source documentation.
- Logged the experiment in the decision log and project minutes.
