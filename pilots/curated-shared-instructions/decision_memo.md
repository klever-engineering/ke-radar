# Decision Memo - Curated shared instructions for software teams

## Decision
Continue (pilot shows value; needs real-task validation)

## Rationale
- Strategic fit: Improves agentic reliability and explainability, aligned with AE2.0 Delivery & Engineering Excellence.
- Pain relief: Reduces manual prompt assembly effort and standardizes quality checks.
- Evidence: Pilot metrics show 10 minutes estimated time saved, accuracy 0.5 → 1.0, explainability 0/5 → 5/5.

## Metrics Summary
- time_saved: 10.0 minutes (estimated per task)
- accuracy: 0.5 → 1.0
- explainability: 0/5 → 5/5

## Risks
- Risk: Time_saved is estimated, not instrumented.
- Mitigation: Apply to real tasks and record time-on-task in the next cycle.

## Request to CTO
- Approval requested: Continue pilot with real tasks next week.
- Merge / move to `/repositories`? No (not yet).
